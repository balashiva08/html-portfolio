<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m B. Bala Shiva Kumar, a passionate and driven senior undergraduate pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
   with a specialization in AI & ML at Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, Hyderabad. With a strong academic foundation
   complemented by a diploma in Civil Engineering, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to problem-solving.</p>

<p>My core interests lie in Web Development, Business Analysis, and Video Editing & VFX.
   I’ve worked on practical projects including Face Recognition using Python and an Automated Loan Approval Prediction System using machine learning,
   showcasing my growing expertise in data-driven applications.
   I’m proficient in tools and languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (beginner), Python (beginner), VS Code, GitHub, and Adobe Premiere Pro.
